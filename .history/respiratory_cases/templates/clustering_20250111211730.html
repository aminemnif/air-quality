        <h1>Clustering Analysis of Air Quality & Respiratory Health</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to analyze the relationship between air quality data and respiratory health outcomes using clustering techniques.
                By examining pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3, the analysis identifies regions and times of year where health risks are highest.
                The insights can inform public health strategies for mitigating respiratory cases and hospital admissions.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Used</h2>
            <p>The analysis was performed using a dataset covering air quality measurements and respiratory health impacts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pollutants:</strong> PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO</li>
                <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Respiratory Cases, Hospital Admissions, Cardiovascular Cases, Health Impact Score</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>The following clustering methods were applied to the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Grouped data based on the similarities of air quality and health impact metrics, revealing patterns in high-risk regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Agglomerative Clustering:</strong> Provided insights into the hierarchical relationships between different pollutants and their effects on respiratory health.</li>
                <li><strong>DBSCAN Clustering:</strong> Identified outliers with extreme pollution levels and highlighted regions where health risks deviated from the norm.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>The analysis yielded several important findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regions with elevated levels of PM2.5 and PM10 showed a significant correlation with increased respiratory cases and hospital admissions.</li>
                <li>Clusters revealed seasonal trends in air quality and health impacts, with higher risks during winter months due to increased pollutants.</li>
                <li>Outliers, identified through DBSCAN, pointed to areas with unusually high pollution levels, requiring immediate attention for public health interventions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The clustering analysis provides actionable insights for targeting pollution reduction efforts in high-risk regions. 
                This can help guide policymaking to reduce respiratory diseases and hospital admissions, ultimately improving public health and air quality standards.
